I have created this repo in order to provide a sample for people of some of my previouse work. This is obviousely 
not complrehensive as not all of the code I have written is soely my own, however, hopefully some of the samples
of projects I have worked on will be interesting. I will try and organise things by language in order to attempt
to maintain some seblance of order.
